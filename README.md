## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to the DSA problems, which will be solved in a structured manner. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills and strengthen the understanding of core DSA concepts, which are essential for competitive programming, coding interviews, and technical assessments.

## Problem Sheet

The problems in this repository are taken from the **DSA Question Sheet by Shradha Didi & Aman Bhaiya**. These problems cover various topics including:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- And many more...

The problems are being solved sequentially, and each solution will be tested for edge cases and efficiency.

## Problem Solving Process

1. **Problem Understanding**: Read and comprehend the problem statement.
2. **Algorithm Design**: Plan an efficient algorithm to solve the problem.
3. **Code Implementation**: Implement the solution using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
4. **Testing**: Test the solution with multiple test cases, including edge cases.
5. **Optimization**: Optimize the solution if needed to improve time and space complexity.
6. **Documentation**: Ensure that the code is well-commented and easy to understand.


## Languages and Tools

- **Programming Languages**: Java
- **Tools**: 
  - Code Editors: VS Code
  - Version Control: Git
